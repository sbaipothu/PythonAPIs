commands:
create virtual env
pip install djangorestframework
django-admin startproject DjangoDemo 
or
django-admin startproject djangodemo . -> Here . creates the project in current directory
python manage.py migrate -> creates the database
python manage.py runserver

python manage.py startapp api_basics
python manage.py createsuperuser -> enter username, emailid and password

Navigate to url http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and login to the app using above credentials

Serializer:
Create a model Article in api_basics and then migrate
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

Register the model in api_basics/admin.py

Add serializers.py and create serializer for the model

From commandline we can insert few articles to play with 
 from api_basics.models import Article
from api_basics.serializers import ArticleSerializer
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser

a = Article(title='Article Title', author='Trivikram', email = 'test@gmail.com')
a.save()

a = Article(title='Akhanda', author='Boya', email = 'boya@gmail.com')
a.save()

serializer = ArticleSerializer(a)
serializer.data

content = JSONRenderer().render(serializer.data)
content

serializer = ArticleSerializer(Article.objects.all(), many=True)
serializer.data

Now
Create ArticleSerializer from ModelSerializer 

on command line check the representation by using below commands
serializer = ArticleSerializer()
print(repr(serializer)

Function Based API Views
csrf_exempt
api_view decorator

Class Based API Views
Create class in views.py and update the same in urls.py of the project


Generic Views and Mixins


Authentication
BasicAuthentication - Usersname and password - Should be used only when api is https
TokenAuthentication - Suitable for client - server
SessionAuthenticaton - It is appropriate for AJAX clients running in the same site
Import the classes and add them to authentication_classes

Viewsets and Routes
ViewSets -> Based on views. It doesn't provide get, post type of methods instead it provides list, create, retreive, etc

GenericViewSet -> similar to genericview

ModalViewSet ->  inherits GenericAPIView. Doesn't requires much code just by adding serializer and query set we can access all methods
